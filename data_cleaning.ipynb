    "# How to use this notebook\n",
    "Each of the following sections (called 'cells' in Jupyter terminology) has a brief explanation of the purpose of the activity, the code contained and how to run it. If you aren't sure at any time, you can always go to Moodle and ask a question in the forum.\n",
    "Some of the cells contain code, there are usually denoted by a marker such as In [1]. There are a number of ways to run the code in these cells and these vary depending on how you are accessing the notebook (Binder, PyCharm, VS Code etc). \n",
    "Some of the common ways to run code in a cell are, for each you typically need to click into the cell first before running:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look for a menu option such as `Cell > Run Cells and Select Below`\n",
    "- Look for a `run` icon near the cell. In PyCharm for example there is a double green arrow at the start of the code in the cell.\n",
    "- Click into the cell itself and then press the Ctrl key on your computer and hold that while you also press the Enter key\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a cell has run you will typically see some output appear below it. Some cells may take a few seconds to run. Sometimes, if there is no output and no errors, you may not see anything - this should be the case when you run the first cell which loads the libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you need to run the cells in order, typically one cell relies on the outcome of the previous cell so if you skip a cell you may get errors.\n",

    "# Data cleaning and pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleansing and preparation is the most critical first step in any data science project. Evidence shows that data scientists will up to 70% of their time cleaning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through an example of the initial steps of data cleansing and pre-processing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we will use for this activity has already been downloaded and is available to the notebook as ```CGD - COVID education policy tracking.csv```. The dataset was downloaded from the [Centre for Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/schools-out-now-what).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the aim of the project is to answer the question \"At what point in the Covid pandemic should a country close schools?\" which we are going to answer by creating a bar chart showing the median reported cases of Covid at the time schools were closed in each region. This is a simplistic use of the data set, however the basic data cleaning principles are the same as you might use for your coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to import the Python libraries that you will use for pre-processing the data. The most popular Python libraries for working with data are Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas. You may have used Numpy and Pandas in COMP00015 Intro to programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is mathematical library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is used for importing and managing data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is used for making charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import these libraries using a shortcut alias. Run the following cell."

    "## Handle missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values can be the most common feature of unclean data. These values are usually in the form of NaN or None.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons for values to be missing, for example because they don't exist, or because of improper data collection or improper data entry. For example, if someone is underage and the issue applies to someone older than 18, the question will contain missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to deal with missing values:\n",
    "- Do nothing (this may be appropriate in some circumstances).\n",
    "- If your data set is large enough and/or the percentage of missing values is high, you may choose to delete the rows and columns that contain the missing data;\n",
    "- Use an imputation technique to fill the missing values (e.g. mean, median, most frequent etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision will depend on the type of data, the actions you want to perform on the data, and the reasons for the missing values. [This article on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/6-different-ways-to-compensate-for-missing-values-data-imputation-with-examples-6022d9ca0779) gives pros and cons of some common imputation techniques. You are not expected to understand the specific imputation techniques and make an informed choice to apply to your coursework. For this course it is sufficient that you understand the implications of missing data and make an informed decision whether to do nothing, remove data or use imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling inconsistent values\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are different unique values in the column, an inconsistency can occur. Examples include:\n",
    "- Text data: Imagine a text field that contains 'Juvenile', 'juvenile' and ' juvenile ' in the same column, you could remove spaces and convert all data to lowercase. If there are a large number of inconsistent unique entries, you cannot manually check the closest match, in which case there are various packages that can be used (e.g. Fuzzy Wuzzy string matching).\n",
    "- Date/time data: Inconsistent date format, such as dd / mm / yy and mm / dd / yy in the same column. Your date value may not be the correct data type, which will not allow you to perform actions efficiently and gain insight from it. \n",
    "\n",
